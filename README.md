## Installation of html2canvas and jsPDF

To install `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`, run the following command:

```

## Features

import jsPDF from "jspdf";
```

2. Add a button to capture an HTML element and save it as a PDF:

```javascript
const handleDownloadPDF = async () => {
  const element = document.getElementById("content-to-capture");
  const canvas = await html2canvas(element);
  const imgData = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
  const pdf = new jsPDF();
  pdf.addImage(imgData, "PNG", 10, 10, 190, 0);
  pdf.save("download.pdf");
};

return (
  <div>
    <div id="content-to-capture">
      <h1>Content to Capture</h1>
      <p>This content will be captured and exported as a PDF.</p>
    </div>
    <button onClick={handleDownloadPDF}>Download PDF</button>
  </div>
);
```
